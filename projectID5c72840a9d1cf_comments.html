<HTML><BODY>A long piece of Scottish historical fiction, somewhat similar to Waverley by Walter Scott, although in his preface, the author denies this is intentional.

<p>The scans are from a one volume <a href="https://archive.org/details/wolfeofbadenochh00dickuoft/page/n3">reprint</a> from 1886; the first edition appeared in three volumes in 1827, 13 years after Waverley. Scans for these are here: Volume <a href="https://archive.org/details/wolfeofbadenochh01laud/page/n8">I</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/details/wolfeofbadenochh02laud/page/n8">II</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/details/wolfeofbadenochh03laud/page/n8">III</a>.

</p><p>Out of the 633 pages, three pages have been slightly blurred, but are still readable, even though the OCR falters on them. Please don't mark them bad, and if needed, make a detour to the original scans to resolve them (<a href="https://archive.org/details/wolfeofbadenochh00dickuoft/page/560">557.png-558.png</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/details/wolfeofbadenochh00dickuoft/page/n635">633.png</a>). I will also double check during PP.

</p><p>Have Fun!
